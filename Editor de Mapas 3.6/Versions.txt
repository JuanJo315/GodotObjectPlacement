Version 1: Creating a level editor 
	
	Added a user interface to place items 
	Tab bar with different items in each section 
	Hid the item on the interface 
	
Version 2: Camera Movement 
	
	Added Zoom In and Out functions 
	Added movement through the WASD Keys 
	Added Click and Drag with the Middle Mouse button 

Version 3: Game Mode 
	
	Used a Singleton to switch game modes 
	Used Input "toggle_editor" with Key E in the 
	tab_container script to hide it and start the game 
	while keeping the tiles position before it runs 

Version 4: Player Control 
	
	Cambiar el TileMap por individual tiles
	Se crea un Nodo donde se arrastra el PNG 
	que se quiera dividir en tiles individuales 
	
	We use NinePatchRect and set the Region Rect 
	to 32 by 32 so we get 1 tile and w and h are used 
	to move the region 
	
	Can also be done through the Edit Region 
	Square Adjust Mode and 32 by 32 steps
	We save the scene and convert to a TileSet
	
	Can't do it, will try to resolve later through 
	another project code and use a png as a place holder 
	
Version 5: Save and Load Files
