We need to change the Item_Selector 
type from a Control Node to a Canvas Layer 
through a "Change Type" after right clicking it 

This is because a Control node will stay in place 
when the player moves around the map, so the menu 
won't follow it 

The canvas layer makes it so it's always there 

To also avoid creating items when clicking on the tab 
we add a hide function and add a script to a scroll container 

For the camera we create a Node2D called camera_container
and tried to add zoom in, out and panoramic mode 

Didn't work so we try another method

We add keyboard shortcuts for the camera with 
the WASD keys, wheel up and down and the middle 
mouse button in the input map section
